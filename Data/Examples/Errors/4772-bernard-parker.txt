# Explanation
Bernard,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #4772, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for non-compliance (7) and substance abuse (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (9). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial_problems (9), prior offenses (0), social environment (4), charge degree (F), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data (e.g. age, sex, race, etc.) were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
