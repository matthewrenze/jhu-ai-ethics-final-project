Richard,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #142, you had a COMPAS risk score of 8 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal attitude (8), a high risk score for noncompliance (6), and a high risk score for substance abuse (8). These were the three most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (7) and a high number of prior offenses (9). These factors contributed to the high importance of the number of prior offenses in the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (3), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Corrections
- Line 26: Fixed priors_count_level: medium -> high
- Line 27: Fixed vocational_level: low -> medium
- Line 32: Fixed criminal_attitude_importance_level: high -> low

# Explanation
- The priors_count feature had a value of 9, which is high, so the feature level was corrected from medium to high.
- The vocational feature had a value of 4, which is medium, so the feature level was corrected from low to medium.
- The criminal_attitude feature had a high risk score of 8, but it was incorrectly listed as having high importance. It was corrected to low importance.
