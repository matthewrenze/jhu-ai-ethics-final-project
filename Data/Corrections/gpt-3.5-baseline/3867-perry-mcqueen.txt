Perry,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #3867, you had a COMPAS risk score of 5 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for number of prior offenses (22) and a high risk score for family criminality (8). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for substance abuse (5) and noncompliance (4). However, these factors only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (5) and social environment risk (11), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
