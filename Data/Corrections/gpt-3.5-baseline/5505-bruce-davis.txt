Bruce,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #5505, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for social environment (10) and a high risk score for family criminality (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a low risk score for substance abuse (2) and a low risk score for noncompliance (2). However, these factors were of high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (1), criminal associates (4), and criminal attitude (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
