Dewayne,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2871, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (8). This was the most important factor in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (9) and a high risk score for criminal associates (8). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), number of prior offenses (0), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score. However, it is important to note that both financial problems and vocational risk factors were assessed as high risk.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
