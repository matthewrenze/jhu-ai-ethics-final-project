","Sharkiem,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #10007, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6) and a high risk score for criminal attitude (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (7), family criminality (5), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Anthony,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #1254, you had a COMPAS risk score of 8 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (10) and a high risk score for noncompliance (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for number of prior offenses (20). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including family criminality (5), social environment risk (7), and vocational risk factors (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Alex,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2292, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for family criminality (7) and a high risk score for criminal associates (4). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for noncompliance (5). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including substance abuse (4), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (1), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

You also had a medium risk score for number of prior offenses (13). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including criminal attitude (5), criminal associates (4), and family criminality (2), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Dijohn,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #531, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (10) and a high risk score for criminal attitude (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (7). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (6), family criminality risk (6), substance abuse risk (7), and vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low to medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Brion,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #6439, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6), a high risk score for substance abuse (7), and a high risk score for criminal attitude (7). These were the three most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (7). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (5), family criminality risk (4), financial problems (5), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Peter,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7496, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a high risk score for criminal associates (9). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for family criminality (8). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (8), vocational risk factors (10), and substance abuse (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (5), family criminality risk (5), criminal attitude risk (5), social environment risk (6), and vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Joanne,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8473, you had a COMPAS risk score of 7 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a medium risk score for substance abuse (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (8), social environment risk (7), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

","Sara,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9584, you had a COMPAS risk score of 7 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (7), a high risk score for substance abuse (6), and a high risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the three most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), family criminality risk (5), social environment risk (8), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
