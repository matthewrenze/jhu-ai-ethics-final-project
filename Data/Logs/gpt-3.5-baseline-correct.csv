# Explanation
Sharkiem,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #10007, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6) and a high risk score for criminal attitude (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (7), family criminality (5), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Terrence,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #10964, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (6), a high risk score for noncompliance (5), and a high risk score for number of prior offenses (9). These were the three most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for criminal associates (4). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (1), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Nicole,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #1859, you had a COMPAS risk score of 3 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for family criminality (7) and a medium risk score for criminal attitude (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including substance abuse (6), noncompliance (6), financial problems (7), social environment risk (7), and vocational risk factors (7), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

# Explanation
Thomas,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2278, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for noncompliance (1) and a low risk score for substance abuse (3). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal attitude (8). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (4), number of prior offenses (0), and social environment risk (10), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Jerome,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2793, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (10) and a high risk score for substance abuse (10). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (11), social environment risk (5), and family criminality risk (4), etc. were of low or medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Dewayne,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2871, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (8) and a high risk score for substance abuse (9). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (8). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), social environment risk (4), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

You also had a high risk score for criminal attitude (8). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (8), substance abuse (7), and number of prior offenses (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Regarding your case record #4634, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (6) and a medium risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for family criminality (5) and criminal associates (5). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (4), c_charge_degree (Misdemeanor), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

Regarding your case record #5852, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for criminal attitude (1) and a low risk score for substance abuse (1). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a low risk score for noncompliance (2). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (2), number of prior offenses (1), and social environment risk (7), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Donald,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #5914, you had a COMPAS risk score of 3 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6) and a high risk score for substance abuse (4). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a low risk score for criminal associates (3). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (2), family criminality risk (5), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Steve,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #638, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6) and a medium risk score for substance abuse (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for number of prior offenses (8). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), family criminality risk (5), and social environment risk (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Emmet,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7143, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for noncompliance (3) and a low risk score for substance abuse (3). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for social environment risk (7). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (4), number of prior offenses (1), and family criminality risk (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Deanna,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7774, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a high risk score for substance abuse (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (9). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (7), number of prior offenses (6), and social environment risk (3), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

It is worth noting that the degree of the charges (Misdemeanor) was also a factor in your overall risk score. This feature was of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

","Travis,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8299, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a high risk score for substance abuse (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a low risk score for financial problems (1). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (2), social environment risk (4), and vocational risk factors (2), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

# Explanation
Kevin,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8406, you had a COMPAS risk score of 8 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6), a high risk score for substance abuse (8), and a high risk score for financial problems (8). These were the three most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (5), family criminality risk (5), criminal attitude risk (5), social environment risk (6), and vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

# Explanation
Steven,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8812, you had a COMPAS risk score of 3 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for family criminality (7) and a high risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (1). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (3), criminal associates (5), and vocational risk factors (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

Terrance,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9097, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (4) and a high risk score for substance abuse (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for number of prior offenses (6). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (8), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (7), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Stephanie,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #963, you had a COMPAS risk score of 5 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for family criminality (7) and a high risk score for noncompliance (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (6) and criminal associates (7). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (4), number of prior offenses (1), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

# Explanation
Rabe,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9659, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (6) and a high risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for substance abuse (5). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (3), c_charge_degree (M), and social environment risk (3), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
