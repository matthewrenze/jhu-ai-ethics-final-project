","Sharkiem,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #10007, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6) and a medium risk score for substance abuse (4). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (7), number of prior offenses (0), and social environment risk (2), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a high risk score for substance abuse (10). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for the number of prior offenses (20). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including criminal associates (3), financial problems (4), and social environment risk (7), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

","Alex,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2292, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a medium risk score for noncompliance (5) and a medium risk score for substance abuse (4). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (4). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (0), financial problems (1), and vocational risk factors (1), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

","Victor,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #3425, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (8). This was the most important factor in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (7) and a high risk score for criminal associates (9). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (4), financial problems (8), and number of prior offenses (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

","Monique,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #5436, you had a COMPAS risk score of 2 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for noncompliance (3) and a low risk score for substance abuse (2). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (9), number of prior offenses (1), and financial problems (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

","Lashunda,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #6877, you had a COMPAS risk score of 2 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a medium risk score for noncompliance (5) and a low risk score for criminal associates (1). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (2), substance abuse (5), and financial problems (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (3), financial problems (7), and number of prior offenses (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Evenson,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7791, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (9) and a high risk score for noncompliance (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (9). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (4), number of prior offenses (1), and vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

","Alain,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8520, you had a COMPAS risk score of 6 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (6). This was the most important factor in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (6). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (4), financial problems (4), and criminal associates (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

","Rabe,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9659, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (6) and a medium risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for substance abuse (5). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (3), number of prior offenses (0), and social environment risk (3), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
