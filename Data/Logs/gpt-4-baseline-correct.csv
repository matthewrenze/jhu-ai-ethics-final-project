# Explanation
Terrence,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #10964, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (6), a high risk score for noncompliance (5), and a high risk score for the number of prior offenses (9). These were the three most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for criminal associates (4). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (1), social environment risk (5), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

# Explanation
Dewayne,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2871, you had a COMPAS risk score of 9 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (8). This was the most important factor in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (9) and a high risk score for criminal associates (8). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), number of prior offenses (0), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Explanation
Yonnatan,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7036, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for noncompliance (3). This was the most important factor in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for substance abuse (4) and a medium risk score for criminal associates (3). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (0), financial problems (6), and social environment risk (5), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #7136, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (8). This was the most important factor in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (8) and a high risk score for criminal associates (9). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (8), financial problems (6), and number of prior offenses (3), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (0), social environment risk (7), and financial problems (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

# Explanation
Sara,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9584, you had a COMPAS risk score of 7 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (7), a high risk score for substance abuse (6), and a medium risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the three most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (6), number of prior offenses (0), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.
