{first_name},

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #{case_id}, you had a COMPAS risk score of {decile_score} on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a {decile_score_level} risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had {high_features}. {high_followup_sentence}

You also had {medium_features}. {medium_followup_sentence}

The remaining risk factors including {low_features}, etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
