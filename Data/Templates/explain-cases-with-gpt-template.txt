[first-name],

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #[case-id], you had a COMPAS risk score of [decile-score] on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a [high|medium|low] risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had [low|medium|high] risk score for [highest-importance-feature] (score), a [low|medium|high] risk score for [2nd-highest-importance-feature] ([score]), and a [low|medium|high] risk score for [3rd-highest-importance-feature] ([score]). These were the [n] most important factors in receiving a [high|medium|low] overall risk score.

You also had a [low|medium|high] risk score for [highest-medium-importance-features] ([score]), a [low|medium|high] risk score for [2nd-highest-medium-importance-features] ([score]), and a [low|medium|high] risk score for [3rd-highest-medium-importance-features] ([score]). However, [this factor|these factors] only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including [highest-low-risk-features] ([score]), [2nd-highest-low-risk-features] ([score]), [3rd-highest-low-risk-features] ([score]), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data (e.g. age, sex, race, etc.) were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
