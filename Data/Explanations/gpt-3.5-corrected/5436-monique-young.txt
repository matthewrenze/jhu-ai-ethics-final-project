Monique,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #5436, you had a COMPAS risk score of 2 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (6) and a high risk score for criminal attitude (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for noncompliance (3). However, this factor only contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including social environment risk (9), vocational risk factors (9), and high financial problems (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
