Miguel,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #3310, you had a COMPAS risk score of 3 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for family criminality (7) and a high risk score for financial problems (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for substance abuse (4). This factor contributed high importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including noncompliance (4), social environment risk (6), and vocational risk factors (4), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
