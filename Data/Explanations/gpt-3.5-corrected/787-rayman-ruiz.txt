Rayman,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #787, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for substance abuse (7) and a medium risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for criminal associates (4) and a high risk score for number of prior offenses (7). However, these factors only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including family criminality (6), criminal attitude (5), social environment risk (3), vocational risk factors (1), and financial problems (1), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Corrections
- Line 22: Fixed priors_count_level: medium -> high
- Line 23: Fixed family_criminality_level: medium -> high
- Line 29: Fixed noncompliance_level: high -> medium

I corrected the priors_count_level from medium to high because the defendant had a high number of prior offenses (7).
I corrected the family_criminality_level from medium to high because the defendant had a high family criminality risk score (6).
I corrected the noncompliance_level from high to medium because the defendant had a medium noncompliance risk score (5).
