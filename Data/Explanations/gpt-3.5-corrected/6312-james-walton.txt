James,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #6312, you had a COMPAS risk score of 5 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for number of prior offenses (9), a medium risk score for noncompliance (5), and a medium risk score for substance abuse (4). These were the three most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for family criminality (6) and a low risk score for criminal associates (3). However, these factors only contributed high and low importance, respectively, to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (7), social environment risk (5), vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
