Rabe,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #9659, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (6) and a medium risk score for noncompliance (5). These were the two most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had a medium risk score for substance abuse (5). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (3), c_charge_degree (M), and social environment risk (3), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Corrections
- Line 31: Fixed c_charge_degree_level: medium -> low
- Line 32: Fixed noncompliance_level: high -> medium
- Line 39: Fixed c_charge_degree_importance_level: medium -> low

I corrected the c_charge_degree_level from medium to low because Misdemeanor (M) is considered a low degree of charges. I corrected the noncompliance_level from high to medium because it was a medium risk factor. I corrected the c_charge_degree_importance_level from medium to low because it was of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.
