Joanne,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #8473, you had a COMPAS risk score of 7 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (7) and a high risk score for substance abuse (6). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (6). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including financial problems (8), social environment risk (7), and vocational risk factors (6), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI

# Corrections
- Line 26: Fixed substance_abuse_level: medium -> high
- Line 27: Fixed vocational_level: medium -> high

I corrected the substance_abuse_level from medium to high because the feature importance level for substance abuse is medium and the risk score for substance abuse is high. 

I corrected the vocational_level from medium to high because the feature importance level for vocational factors is medium and the risk score for vocational factors is high.
