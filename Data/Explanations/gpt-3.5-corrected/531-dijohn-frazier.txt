Dijohn,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #531, you had a COMPAS risk score of 10 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a high risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for noncompliance (10) and a high risk score for criminal attitude (7). These were the two most important factors in receiving a high overall risk score.

You also had a high risk score for criminal associates (7). However, this factor only contributed low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (6), family criminality risk (6), substance abuse risk (7), and vocational risk factors (8), etc. were of low to medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
