Dorothy,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #5852, you had a COMPAS risk score of 1 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a low risk score for noncompliance (2) and a low risk score for substance abuse (1). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had a low risk score for criminal associates (3). However, this factor only contributed medium importance to the COMPAS algorithm's scoring of your overall risk.

The remaining risk factors including number of prior offenses (1), financial problems (2), and social environment risk (7), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
