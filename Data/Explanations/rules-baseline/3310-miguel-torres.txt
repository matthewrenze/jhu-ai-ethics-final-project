Miguel,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #3310, you had a COMPAS risk score of 3 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a low risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a medium risk score for noncompliance (4) and a medium risk score for substance abuse (4). These were the two most important factors in receiving a low overall risk score.

You also had no medium importance risk factors. 

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (4), criminal associates (5), and number of prior offenses (1), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
