Lavena,

Thank you for sharing your case record for our review. 

Regarding your case record #2143, you had a COMPAS risk score of 4 on a scale of 1-10. This means you were scored as a medium risk for reoffending.

You received this score primarily because you had a high risk score for criminal associates (7), a low risk score for substance abuse (3), and a medium risk score for noncompliance (4). These were the three most important factors in receiving a medium overall risk score.

You also had no medium importance risk factors. 

The remaining risk factors including vocational risk factors (4), financial problems (5), and number of prior offenses (0), etc. were of low importance to the COMPAS algorithm's score.

Demographic data including age, sex, race, etc., were not included in the algorithm's decision because they are protected by law.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Explainable AI
